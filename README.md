<h1>Security Risk Assessment: Social Media Organization Data Breach</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
As a security analyst for a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach, I conducted a security risk assessment to identify key vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation strategies. The breach compromised customer personal information (names and addresses), highlighting critical weaknesses in the organization's network security posture. This assessment focuses on four critical vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure: shared employee passwords, default database admin password, inadequate firewall rules, and the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to preventing future breaches, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining customer trust.

<h2>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>

1. Shared Employee Passwords: Employees are sharing passwords, which increases the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Default Database Admin Password: The database administrator account uses the default password.

3. Inadequate Firewall Rules: The firewalls lack rules to filter inbound and outbound network traffic.

4. Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA is not implemented for user authentication.
 
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>

The identified vulnerabilities pose the following risks:

1. Unauthorized Access: Shared passwords and default passwords make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

2. Data Exfiltration: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to the exfiltration of customer data, resulting in financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities (e.g., GDPR violations), and loss of customer trust.

3. System Compromise: Lack of proper firewall rules exposes the organization's systems to various network-based attacks, such as malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, and unauthorized access.

4. Account Takeover: The absence of MFA makes user accounts more susceptible to takeover attacks, where attackers can gain control of accounts and perform malicious actions.

<h2>Recommended Hardening Tools and Methods</h2>

To mitigate the identified risks, I recommend implementing the following network hardening tools and methods:

1. Password Policy Enforcement: Implement a strong password policy with requirements such as:

   - Minimum 12-character length

   - Use of mixed-case letters, numbers, and symbols

   - 90-day password changes

   - Prohibition of reuse and enforcement of password history

   - Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

   - Employee education on password security

   - Use of a centralized password management system

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation:

   - Deploy MFA, especially for administrative accounts

   - Use combined authentication factors:

   - Knowledge (password)

   - Possession (e.g., TOTP app, hardware token)

   - Inherence (biometrics)

   - Enforce MFA for remote network access

3. Firewall Hardening and Maintenance:

   - Implement a stateful firewall with the principle of least privilege.

   - Establish strict firewall rules, including:

   - Blocking non-essential inbound port traffic

   - Limiting outbound traffic to required protocols and ports

   - Regular (quarterly) review and updates of firewall rules

   - Implementation of IDS/IPS for malicious traffic monitoring

   - Enabling and analyzing firewall logs

   - Maintaining up-to-date firewall software and firmware

<h2>Effectiveness of Recommended Methods</h2>

The recommended hardening measures will effectively manage the identified vulnerabilities and prevent future breaches in the following ways:

Password Policy Enforcement: A strong password policy will significantly increase the difficulty for attackers to guess or crack passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Regular password changes will limit the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring attackers to provide multiple forms of verification, even if they know the correct password. This makes account takeover attacks substantially more difficult.

Firewall Hardening and Maintenance: Properly configured firewalls act as a barrier between the organization's network and external threats, blocking unauthorized access and preventing network-based attacks. Regular maintenance ensures that the firewall remains effective against evolving threats.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This security risk assessment identified critical vulnerabilities that contributed to a recent data breach and could lead to future incidents. The recommended hardening measures, including strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and robust firewall configuration and maintenance, provide a layered security approach that significantly reduces the attack surface and enhances the organization's overall security posture. By implementing these measures proactively and maintaining them consistently, the organization can minimize the risk of future attacks, protect sensitive customer data, and demonstrate a commitment to security best practices.
